# Building a frontend for both mobile and web using React and React Native

## Introduction

Building a compartmentalized frontend for both mobile and web involves creating a shared codebase that can be used across different platforms. This can be achieved using a cross-platform framework like React and React Native. Here's a step-by-step guide:  

1. `Set up your project`: Create a new project directory and initialize it with npm or yarn. This will create a package.json file which will keep track of your project's dependencies.  

2. `Install React and React Native`: Install React for the web part of your application and React Native for the mobile part. You can do this by running npm install react react-dom and npm install react-native.  

3. `Create a shared components directory`: This will house all the components that will be shared across both platforms. Each component should check the platform it's currently running on and render the appropriate JSX. You can use Platform.OS from React Native to determine the current platform.  

4. `Create platform-specific directories`: These directories will contain components and configurations that are specific to each platform. You can have a web directory for web-specific components and a native directory for mobile-specific components.  

5. `Implement navigation`: For web, you can use react-router-dom and for mobile, you can use react-navigation.  

6. `Manage state`: Use a state management library like Redux or the built-in Context API to manage shared state across your application.  

Here's a basic example of how you can structure your project:

```javascript
// shared/Button.js
import { Platform, Button as RNButton } from 'react-native';
import { Button as WebButton } from 'react-bootstrap';

const Button = (props) => {
  if (Platform.OS === 'web') {
    return <WebButton {...props} />;
  } else {
    return <RNButton {...props} />;
  }
};

export default Button;
```

In this example, Button.js is a shared component that renders a different button depending on the platform. 
For web, it renders a button from react-bootstrap, and for mobile, it renders a button from react-native.  

Remember to keep your components small and focused to make them easier to share and reuse across different 
parts of your application.

## State Management in React

There are several popular state management libraries for React. Here are a few:  

1. `Redux`: This is a predictable state container for JavaScript apps. It helps you write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments (client, server, and native), and are easy to test.  

2. `MobX`: MobX is a battle-tested library that makes state management simple and scalable by transparently applying functional reactive programming (TFRP). The philosophy behind MobX is very simple: Anything that can be derived from the application state, should be derived automatically.  

3. `Context API`: This is a feature of React itself (not a library) that allows you to share state without having to pass props through multiple levels. It's not as robust as Redux or MobX, but it's great for smaller applications or specific parts of larger ones.  

4. `Zustand`: Zustand is a small, fast and scaleable bearbones state-management solution. It has a simple and intuitive API.  

5. `Recoil`: Recoil is a state management library for React with a focus on minimalism and flexibility. It was developed by Facebook to handle state that's shared across many components at different levels.  

6. `Jotai`: Jotai is a primitive and flexible state management library for React, based on the atomic model. It's great for managing complex state that's deeply nested or shared across many components.  

Remember, the best library depends on your specific needs and the complexity of your application.
