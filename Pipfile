#  Pipfile contains the specification for the project top-level requirements
#  and any desired specifiers. This file is managed by the developers invoking
#  pipenv commands. The Pipfile uses inline tables and the TOML Spec.
#
#  Pipfile.lock replaces the requirements.txt file used in most Python projects
#  and adds security benefits of tracking the packages hashes that were last locked.
#  This file is managed automatically through locking actions.
#
#  You should add both Pipfile and Pipfile.lock to the projectâ€™s source control.
